2. Dynamic Market Sentiment Forecaster
Problem statement : Businesses misjudge consumer trends due to static
sentiment analysis that fails to capture evolving opinions across social
media and news, leading to poor marketing decisions and financial losses.
Problem Description : Victims
Companies (Retail/Finance) – Revenue drops from ineffective campaigns.
Investors – Suffer from volatility and misjudged market signals.
Consumers – Receive irrelevant, poorly timed products or ads.
Proposed Solution : An AI/ML-powered sentiment forecasting engine with
agentic AI acting as a sentiment oracle.
Key features :
Autonomous Data Collection – Scrape & process data from social media,
news, and forums via APIs.
Time-Series ML Models – Predict evolving sentiment trends with historical
+ real-time data.
Multi-Source Reasoning – Detect opinion shifts by cross-analyzing
heterogeneous inputs.
Market Forecasting – Link sentiment patterns to financial or consumer
behavior impacts.
Proactive Alerts & Strategy Suggestions – Notify businesses/investors
with adaptive recommendations.
Self-Improvement – Reinforcement learning to refine accuracy from past
performance.
Compulsory functionality: The engine must use agentic AI to autonomously
collect and process data from social media and news, build time-series
models to predict sentiment trends, reason over multi-source inputs to
detect shifts, forecast market impacts, send proactive alerts with strategy
suggestions, and self-improve accuracy via reinforcement learning from
past predictions.
